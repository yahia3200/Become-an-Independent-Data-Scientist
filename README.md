## Skills Used in This Project
* pandas
* matplotlib
* python
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization
## Project Stages
* __State a research question:__ My research was in the environment domain on how the population growth affects the CO2 emissions in Egypt
* __Finding 2 Data Sets:__
    * _Egypt Population:_ http://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_323_201906_Teaching%20Staff%20in%20Education.csv
    * _CO2 Emissions in Egypt:_ https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/MDG_csv.zip
* __Data Cleaning__
* __Data Visualization__
## Results
![](images/final.png)
this visual aims to show how population growth affects the CO2 emissions in Egypt by comparing the population to CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2014.
the graphs shows that indeed the population growth increases the CO2 emissions but also we can see that it not the only factor because the correlation between them is not 100%
